                      <br><br>
                      The Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance is an evolution of last year’s contender – the car that won
                      Mercedes its historic sixth consecutive double championship.
                      <br><br>
                      The team has looked at a myriad of areas to improve the car and has changed the vast majority of
                      the over 10,000 parts of the car to extract more performance. The Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ
                      Performance is expected to become the fastest Mercedes race car ever built.
                      <br><br>
                      “The regulations stayed largely the same for the new year, so for us it was all about trying to
                      make sure that we don’t run out of development steam on a package that worked pretty well for us
                      last year,” said James.
                      <br><br>
                      “We wanted to change aspects of the concept of the car – aspects that would be completely
                      impossible to change within a season – to give us a more fertile platform for the new season. We
                      tried to make a few well-chosen architectural changes to keep the development slope strong even
                      though the regulations are now a little bit longer in the tooth.”
                      <br><br>
                      In addition to many detail changes and smaller improvements, the team has introduced three larger
                      changes – one at the front, one at the middle and one at the back of the car.

                  <p> <span>Champion's aerodynamics</span>
                      <br><br>
                      “At the front we have accepted more structural complexity around the uprights and wheel rims in
                      order to provide a higher performance assembly overall,” said James. “In the middle of the car we
                      have followed the pitlane trend by moving our upper side impact tube to the lower position and
                      banking the aerodynamic gain that comes with this layout.
                      <br><br>
                      “At the rear of the car we have gone for an adventurous suspension layout in order to free up
                      aerodynamic development opportunity. All three investments were improvements in their own right,
                      but their real effect is to mobilize a raft of secondary aerodynamic gains both during the winter
                      and, we hope, across the season to come.”
                      <br><br>
                      In 2019, the team brought a significant upgrade to the car after the first week of testing that
                      changed the look of the Melbourne car quite significantly compared to the launch car. This year,
                      the race trim will be much closer to the car that is running at Silverstone today.
                      <br><br>
                      “We will still have upgrades for Melbourne that will come in the second week of testing, but the
                      ‘entire new car’ approach of 2019 won’t feature,” said James. “Last year, the regulations were
                      changed quite significantly, and they were decided quite late in the year.

                      <br><br>
                      “Under those circumstances, doing a launch car and a week two car gave us the chance to build the
                      maximum amount of learning into our Melbourne car. With the regulations being more mature this
                      year and with the opening stab of the 2020 development already being at the same level as the
                      finish of last year’s car, repeating last year’s approach would not make sense.”
                      <br><br>
                      2020 is a special year for the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team as the outfit celebrates its 10th
                      anniversary as the modern Mercedes works team in Formula One. On 14 March 2010, the new Mercedes
                      F1 team competed in its first race, the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix. Since then, the team has started
                      in almost 200 Formula One Grands Prix (198), taken 93 victories, 194 podium places and 48 one-two
                      wins.
                      <br><br>
                      “It’s fantastic that the team is able to celebrate its ten-year anniversary,” said Toto Wolff. “We
                      made our first come-back to F1 over 25 years ago as an engine supplier and then we went all in ten
                      years ago. It shows our long-term commitment – with our own works team and as a Power Unit
                      supplier to valuable customers.
                      <br><br>
                      “We have been a part of Formula One with changing technical regulations, with changes in the
                      Daimler top management, but our commitment to the sport hasn’t changed. It’s great that we get to
                      celebrate our tenth anniversary with the Mercedes works team as one further milestone of this
                      commitment.”

                  <p><span>Preparing for the 2021 season</span>
                      <br><br>
                      One of the biggest challenges in 2020 will be trying to find the right balance between developing
                      the current car and preparing for the massive changes that will be introduce in F1 in the
                      following year. 2021 will see the biggest change to the technical regulations in the history of
                      Formula One which will require virtually every part of the car to be designed and developed from
                      scratch.
                      <br><br>
                      “2020 is an evolution of the current regulations and the gains will be smaller, so you need more
                      time and effort to keep improving your car,” said Toto. “On the other hand, the 2021 regulations
                      are so very different that you need a lot of time to prepare for them. Every month you start later
                      than your competitors will make it more difficult to catch up. You also have the effect of the
                      cost cap which means that you will have fewer resources available to throw at things in 2021.”
                      <br><br>
                      “It’s a massive challenge,” said Toto. “We had a lot of regulatory changes in recent years, but
                      this time we’re effectively tackling a two-year project. Trying to get this right will make 2020
                      the most difficult season, but it is also an amazing opportunity. This team has shown time and
                      again that it loves being challenged and we will face this one with the same passion and
                      determination that has made Mercedes so strong in recent years.”</p>
